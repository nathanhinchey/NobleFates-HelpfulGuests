# Guest Help
A [Noble Fates](https://noblefates.com/) mod to make your lazy guests help out
with literally everything.

## What it does
In the unmodified game, only some tasks are marked to have your guests help
with them. This makes sense, because they might not want to intimidate your
prisoners for you or fight your enemies for you. With this mod, they _do_ help
with even those tasks.

## How it works
I just set `guestHelp = true` for every command in `Commands.octdat` -- so just
like how guests will already do things like help you store things, fight fires,
and tend to the injured, they will now also help with any other command you
have issued. You still can't command them directly.

## How to use it
Put this directory into your `Mods` folder:

`C:\Users\<your name>\AppData\Xobermon, LLC\Noble Fates\Mods`

If you don't have a `Mods` folder, add it, and put this folder in there

If you're seeing this on GitHub, then to download this folder click the little
green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP", then unzip it into your `Mods`
folder.
